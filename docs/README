To install this run the setup.py script as root:

chmod +x setup.py
./setup.py install

It will place the main fluxStyle executable in /usr/bin 
It will also make a dir in /usr/share/fluxstyle-1.0 for all the 
files that fluxStyle uses. fluxStyle depends on libglade, and pygtk 2.4 or newer
2.6+ is recommended.

fluxStyle looks only in the users ~/.fluxbox/styles folder for
styles by default, to change the locations fluxstyle looks edit the config file
that it makes called ".fluxStyle.rc" located in the users $HOME dir.


A 'preview.jpg' in the ~/.fluxbox/styles/yourStyle/preview.jpg is required or you will
get the default 'none' showing that informs you what to do to get a preview.  Several
style makers are creating compliant styles. http://tenr.de/ is one. 

I have the package with preview images up for
download at: http://errr-online.com/fluxbox/ 

If you have any problems using this app please feel free to let me know how I can make
it eaiser to use. email: errr(at)errr-online(dot)com 
or see me in IRC on chat.freenode.net in #fluxbox. Removal
of this app is not exactly simple. as root:

  rm -rf /usr/share/fluxstyle-1.0
  rm -rf /usr/bin/fluxStyle
  rm -rf /usr/lib/python(your version)/site-packages/fluxstyle/

and it will be gone.

Sometimes people have said they have permission problems after installing
this is because of your umask. To solve the problem make sure all the
file installed by fluxstyle are worl readable: chmod a+r 
Next the fluxStyle binary in /usr/bin will need to be: chmod a+rx
