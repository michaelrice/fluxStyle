To install this run the setup.py script as root:

chmod +x setup.py
./setup.py install

It will place the main fluxStyle executable in /usr/bin 
It will also make a dir in /usr/share/fluxstyle-1.0 for all the 
files that fluxStyle uses. fluxStyle depends on libglade, and pygtk 2.4 or newer
2.6+ is reccomended. 

fluxStyle looks only in the users ~/.fluxbox/styles folder for
styles by default, to change the locations fluxstyle looks edit the config file
that it makes called ".fluxStyle.rc" located in the users $HOME dir.


A 'preview.jpg' in the ~/.fluxbox/styles/yourStyle/preview.jpg is required or you will
get the default 'none' showing that informs you what to do to get a preview.  Several
style makers are creating compliant styles. http://tenr.de/ is one. 

I have the package with preview images up for
download at: http://errr-online.com/fluxbox/ 

If you have any problems using this app please feel free to let me know how I can make
it eaiser to use. email: errr(at)errr-online(dot)com 
or see me in IRC on chat.freenode.net in #fluxbox. Removal
of this app is not exactly simple as root: 

  rm -rf /usr/share/fluxstyle-1.0
  rm -rf /usr/bin/fluxStyle
  rm -rf /usr/lib/python(your version)/site-packages/fluxstyle/

and it will be gone.
